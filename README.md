I found [this interesting problem statement](https://twitter.com/YogiKulkarni/status/1513158112861057030) from folks at Sahaj about building a KV store from scratch and this is my playground to play around with it. The problem statement can be found at [PROBLEM.pdf](./PROBLEM.pdf) file in the repo.

My full thought process before the implementation can be found as part of this twitter thread: https://twitter.com/_ashwanthkumar/status/1513567082176077826.
